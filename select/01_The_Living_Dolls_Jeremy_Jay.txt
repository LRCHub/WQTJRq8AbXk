They sit in the back seat
Of their parents car
Not saying a word
Hoping they might not notice
How far away they are
The drapes gathered at the
Side of the window
So you could look out
They might never know
How alone you are

Their thoughts are kept
Behind a veil
Of words hidden
Behind a straight face

They lay buried in books
With knowledge of pictured places
I've had so many dreams
And i'm laying them down
The matching of things
Your pushing everything away
That you don't want at all
And making a way for
The living dolls
Who know of a special place
In the nursery of night
For they remember
They are still children inside
The nursery at night
The livings dolls
Have no time for headaches
Of the grown-up world
They know the ways of money
And their business is gold
And they have what they need
To make their dreams in this world
They're terribly practical,
Yes they are
